# OOPS Project: Rokda Split

## **Project Idea**

The project idea is to develop a Money-Splitting App that simplifies the process of sharing expenses and settling debts among friends or groups. This app aims to streamline the management of shared expenses during trips, outings, or any collaborative activities.

Users can create groups for specific events or occasions and add expenses they've incurred. The app will intelligently divide expenses among participants who have opted for them, ensuring that only those involved bear the costs. The Money-Splitting App will provide clear calculations of who owes how much to whom and who needs to receive payments, simplifying the settlement process.

The Money-Splitting App will be developed primarily using Java, ensuring platform independence and accessibility across various devices.

### **Distinctive Feature**

To make "RokdaSplit" stand out, we have identified and incorporated a distinctive feature: **Smart Expense Optimization**. This innovative feature uses advanced algorithms to intelligently suggest the most efficient expense-sharing options, minimizing financial imbalances within the group. "RokdaSplit" is not just another expense tracker; it's a tool for seamless and equitable financial collaboration.

### **Expanded Scope**

In response to the feedback, we have expanded the project's scope to cater to a wider audience. Alongside managing shared expenses among friends, "RokdaSplit" now offers a feature for **Family Finance Management**. Users can create family groups, track household expenses, and allocate financial responsibilities efficiently. This expansion adds depth and practicality to the application, making it a versatile solution for various financial scenarios.

### **User Login Page**

We understand the importance of user security and interaction. As a result, we are including a **User Login Page** as an integral part of the "RokdaSplit" Money-Splitting App. This login page will enhance user privacy and data security, allowing users to create personalized accounts and access their financial data securely. With this addition, "RokdaSplit" ensures a seamless and protected user experience.

## **Benefits and Impact**

The enhanced "RokdaSplit" Money-Splitting App offers the following benefits and impact:

* Unique Smart Expense Optimization feature for equitable expense sharing.
* Versatility for managing shared expenses among friends and family.
* Robust user security and data protection through the User Login Page.
* A comprehensive solution that simplifies financial collaboration and transparency.
* A practical tool for fostering financial fairness and positive relationships.

## **Plan to Implement Concepts**

The project will incorporate the following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and design principles:

### **Classes and Objects:**

* Define classes to represent User, Group, and, Expense, entities.
* Instantiate objects to represent individual users, groups, and expenses.

### **Constructors and Destructors:**

* Implement constructors to initialize user, group, and expense objects.
* Destructors (in Java, the Garbage Collector handles resource cleanup).

### **Encapsulation and Abstraction:**

* Encapsulate data and methods within classes, providing appropriate access modifiers (public, private, protected) to enforce data hiding and abstraction.
* Ensure data integrity and security.

### **Inheritance (any one type):**

* Implement inheritance by creating specialized expense types (e.g., FoodExpense, TransportationExpense) that inherit from the base Expense class, showcasing extension and specialization.

### **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**

* Utilize dynamic memory allocation techniques, such as creating and managing user and group objects during runtime.

### **Design Principles:**

* Adhere to SOLID principles, including Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion, for modular and maintainable code.

### **Data Persistence:**

* Implement data storage mechanisms (e.g., databases) for storing user profiles, group data, and expense records.

### **User Interfaces:**

* Develop intuitive user interfaces, such as a mobile app or web portal, for user interaction and expense management.

## **Benefits and Impact**

The Money-Splitting App project offers several benefits and impact:

* Simplifies the process of splitting expenses and settling debts among friends or groups, enhancing financial transparency and reducing conflicts.
* Provides a user-friendly and convenient tool for managing shared expenses during trips, outings, and collaborative events.
* Demonstrates proficiency in software development, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and design principles.
* Enhances the resume with a practical application that showcases technical skills, problem-solving, and user-centric design.
* Promotes financial fairness and accountability among users, fostering positive relationships within groups.

The Money-Splitting App project aligns with the evolving need for efficient expense management solutions and demonstrates comprehensive expertise in OOP principles and software development.

Thank you for considering this project proposal. We look forward to the opportunity to develop this application, which will simplify expense-sharing and financial management for users.
